This is a simple web app meant to run on Google App Scripts. It was created for the Spring 2019 semester
to be used internally by the UMD chapter of MaryPIRG, a nonprofit activist organization. The app interacts
with MaryPIRG's Google Spreadsheets and generates lists of potential volunteers to call based on critera
entered in the form on the front end. For privacy, the actual spreadsheet ID has been taken out of the
code.
